# **DogImageGenerator 🐾**
## **SVG Assignment 🎮**

This Android app generates random dog images using the Dog CEO API and allows users to view, save, and manage them through an intuitive interface. The app features three main screens:

1. **Home Screen**: Contains buttons to navigate to other screens.
2. **Generate Dogs Screen**: Displays a "Generate!" button that fetches a random dog image from the API and stores it in an LRU cache.
3. **My Recently Generated Dogs Screen**: A gallery displaying the most recent dog images stored in the cache, with an option to clear the gallery and cache.

The app uses **Jetpack Compose** for building the UI and implements an **LRU cache** to persist the 20 most recent images across app sessions.
